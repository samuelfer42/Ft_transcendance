## Introduction
ft_transcendance is a student project from School 42, showcasing our skills in web development and our ability to create innovative and entertaining experiences. This project is our first attempt at building a full-fledged web application, and we leveraged modern technologies such as Typescript, React, Nestjs, and PostgreSQL to make it happen.

## Project Overview
ft_transcendance is an online pong game with a twist! Not only can you play the classic game of pong with friends or strangers, but you can also chat with them and even send direct messages. This adds a whole new level of interactivity to the classic game, making it a fun and social experience.

## Technology Stack
- Typescript: Used as the primary programming language to ensure the code is maintainable, scalable, and readable.

- React: Used as the front-end framework to build a responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly interface.

- Nestjs: Used as the back-end framework to handle the game logic, user authentication, and database interactions.

- PostgreSQL: Used as the database management system to store user data, game statistics, and chat messages.
